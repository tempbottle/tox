Initial state is `CookieRequesting`. In this status we send up to 8
`CookieRequest` packets every second and waiting for a `CookieResponse` packet.
After receiving a `CookieResponse` packet we change the status to
`HandshakeSending` in which we send up to 8 `CryptoHandshake` packets every
second and waiting for `CryptoHandshake` packet from the other side. When we
received `CryptoHandshake` packet we change the status to `NotConfirmed` and
continue sending `CryptoHandshake` packets because we don't know if the other
side received our `CryptoHandshake` packet. Only after receiving first
`CryptoData` packet we change status to `Established` and stop sending
`CryptoHandshake` packets. In this status connection is considered as fully
established.

It's also possible that we received `CryptoHandshake` packet but didn't create
crypto connection yet. This means that we should skip first two states and use
`NotConfirmed` state as initial. We can do it because `CryptoHandshake` contains
`Cookie` that we can use to send our `CryptoHandshake`.
